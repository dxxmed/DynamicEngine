<div align="center">
A brand new engine built with custom instances.
Build more realistic, and *dynamic* games within Roblox Studio.

What is DynamicEngine? DynamicEngine is a ***almost*** **complete** replacement for all of Roblox's basic objects and systems such as Players, Characters, etc. I've decided that I wanted to create something cool and here it is. Keep in mind that this system is not good for every game, so most of the time you're gonna want to stick with the default Roblox systems.

Built internally from just tables and metatables, it gives you the developer to extend more functionality. Feel free to add more functions to suit your game.

Have fun, and thanks for reading **and or** choosing DynamicEngine!
